# XcodeProjectCLI

A fast, lightweight command-line tool for managing Xcode projects - built entirely in Swift.

Easily integrate it into your development workflow or automate complex refactoring tasks with just a few commands.

ðŸ’š Powered by the excellent [XcodeProj](https://github.com/tuist/XcodeProj) library from [Tuist](https://github.com/tuist).

> [!WARNING]
> This project is currently a work in progress.
> 
> It's being developed primarily as a Swift-based replacement for the Ruby helper used in the [xcodebuild.nvim]
 plugin. However, the design aims to remain flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of use cases.

Right now, you need to build the project from source.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   swift build -c release
   ```

4. The built executable will be located in the `.build/release` directory. You
   can copy it to a directory in your PATH for easier access:

   ```bash
    cp .build/release/XcodeProjectCLI /usr/local/bin/xcodeproj
   ```
